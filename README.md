# timeforlunch
Time for Lunch is a platform for complex adaptive systems. It's focused on providing the minimum required infrastructure for comunities to interact and find productivity in any application. The plan is to:

  - establish a lightweight yet flexible platform for individuals to interact
  - maximize hackability through simple code and visual tools for anyone to edit the system in place (hence adaptive)
  - allow for easy changes by standing on the shoulders of greatness, notably in the use of open source code
  
The project is part of a complexity theory course in the Iowa State University's Department of Architecture. The team is made up of James Elliott, Brandon Fettes, and Sean Wittmeyer. The goal is to design a game or CAS and we chose to build an app, but the idea is that the code and the development and evolution of the system itself is just as much part of the CAS as the app, the users, and it's content are.

### Version
1.0 ish. In development and will be...

### Tech

Time for Lunch uses a number of open source projects to work properly and to allow for extension:

* [CodeIgniter] - simple model-view-controller framework
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - mobile-first UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - duh

### Installation

This will happen soon, an install directory will include some sql and other settings to help get you rolling. The system runs on any modern LAMP stack, be sure to find yourself on PHP 5.1+ and any CodeIgniter compatible database. 

### Plugins

Soon, hopefully.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Simply fork the project and make it your own or shoot me a DM and we'll see where this guy can go.

### Todo's

 - Add ability for text editing
 - Document the API
 - Build out features
 - i18n?
